\title{
Column-wise MLE of distributions defined in the (0, 1) interval
}

\description{
Column-wise MLE of distributions defined in the (0, 1) interval.
}

\usage{
colprop.mle(x, distr = "beta", tol = 1e-07, maxiters = 100, parallel = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A numerical vector with proportions, i.e. numbers in (0, 1) (zeros and ones are not allowed).
}
\item{distr}{
The distribution to fit. "beta" stands for the beta distribution, "logitnorm" is the logistic normal, "unitweibull" is the unit-Weibull and the "sp" is the standard power distribution, "ibeta" is the inflated beta, (0-inflated or 1-inflated, depending on the data), "hsecant01" stands for the hyper-secant, "kumar" is the Kumaraswamy, "simplex" is the simplex distribution, "zil" is the zero inflated logistic normal, and "cbern" is the continuous Bernoulli distribution.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance level up to which the maximisation stops.
}
\item{maxiters}{
The maximum number of iterations the Newton-Raphson will perform.
}
\item{parallel}{
Should the computations take place in parallel? This is for the "spml" only.
}
}

\details{
Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of the beta distribution is performed via Newton-Raphson.
The distributions and hence the functions does not accept zeros. "logitnorm.mle" fits the logistic normal,
hence no nwewton-Raphson is required and the "hypersecant01.mle" uses the golden ratio
search as is it faster than the Newton-Raphson (less calculations).
}

\value{
A matrix with two, columns. The first one contains the parameters of the distribution
and the second columns contains the log-likelihood values.
