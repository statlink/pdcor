MLE of continuous univariate distributions defined on the positive line}

\description{
MLE of continuous univariate distributions defined on the positive line.
}

\usage{
positive.mle(x, distr = "gamma", tol = 1e-07, maxiters = 100)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A vector with positive valued data (zeros are not allowed).
}
\item{distr}{
The distribution to fit. "gamma" stands for the gamma distribution, "chisq" for the \eqn{\chi^2} distribution, "weibull" for the Weibull, "lomax" for the Lomax, "foldnorm" for the folded normal, "betaprime" for the beta-prime distribution, "lognorm" for the log-normal, "logcauchy" for the log-Cauchy, "loglogictic" for the log-logistic distribution. "halfnorm" for the half-normal, "invgauss" for the inverse Gaussian, "pareto" for the Pareto distribution, "exp" for the exponential distribution, "exp2" I do not remember, "maxboltz" for the Maxwell-Boltzman distribution, "rayleigh" is the Rayleigh distribution, "lindley" is the Lindley distribution, "halfcauchy" is the half-Cauchy distribution and "powerlaw" is the power law distribution. The "normlog" is simply the normal distribution where all values are positive. Note, this is not log-normal. It is the normal with a log link. Similarly to the inverse gaussian distribution where the mean is an exponentiated. This comes from the GLM theory. The "epois" stands for the exponential-Poisson, the "gep" for the generalized exponential-Poisson and the "pe" for the Poisson-exponential distribution. The "wp" stands for the Weibull Poisson, the "be" for the beta exponential, the "frechet2" for the two-parameter Frechet, for the  the "zigamma" and "ziweibull" stand for the zero inflated gamma and Weibull distributions, respectively, and they accept zeros.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance level up to which the maximisation stops; set to 1e-07 by default.
}
\item{maxiters}{
The maximum number of iterations the Newton-Raphson will perform.
}
}

\details{
Instead of maximising the log-likelihood via a numerical optimiser we have used a Newton-Raphson algorithm which is faster. See wikipedia for the equations to be solved.
For the t distribution we need the degrees of freedom and estimate the location and scatter parameters.

}

\value{
Usually a list with three elements, but this is not for all cases.
\item{iters}{
The number of iterations required for the Newton-Raphson to converge.}
\item{loglik}{
The value of the maximised log-likelihood.
}
\item{param}{
The vector of the parameters.
}
