MLE of (hyper-)spherical distributions

\description{
MLE of (hyper-)spherical distributions.
}

\usage{
hspher.mle(x, distr = "vmf", ina, full = FALSE, ell = FALSE, tol = 1e-07)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix with directional data, i.e. unit vectors.
}
\item{distr}{
The distribution to fit. Spherical distributions: "purka" is the Purkayastha distribution, and "sipc" is the spherical isotropic projected Cauchy. These are rotationally symmetric distributions. The "wood" is the Wood distribution, a bimodal distribution. The next three are elliptically symmetric distributions. The "kent" is the Kent distribution, "esag" is the elliptically symmetric angular Gaussian and the "sespc" is the spherical elliptically symmetric projected Cauchy distribution.

Spherical and hyper-spherical distributions: "vmf" stands for the von Mises-Fisher distribution, "multivmf" is for the vMF with multiple groups, "acg" is the angular central Gaussian and  and the "pkbd" is the Poisson kernel based distribution. The "spcauchy" and "spcauchy2" are the spherical Cauchy (2 different methods of estimation) ,"pkbd" and "pkbd2" is the Poisson-kernel based distribution, "iag" stands for the independent angular Gaussian distribution, and works for spherical and hyper-spherical data, and "ESAGd" is the generalization to the hyper-sphere.
}
\item{ina}{
A numerical vector with discrete numbers starting from 1, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4,... or a factor variable. Each number denotes a sample or group.
If you supply a continuous valued vector the function will obviously provide wrong results.
}
\item{full}{
If you want some extra information, the inverse of the covariance matrix, set this equal to TRUE. Otherwise leave it FALSE.
}
\item{ell}{
This is for the multivmf.mle only. Do you want the log-likelihood returned? The default value is TRUE.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance value at which to terminate the iterations.
}
}

\details{
For the von Mises-Fisher, the normalised mean is the mean direction. For the concentration parameter, a Newton-Raphson is implemented. For the angular central Gaussian distribution there is a constraint on the estimated covariance matrix; its trace is equal to the number of variables. An iterative algorithm takes place and convergence is guaranteed. Newton-Raphson for the projected normal distribution, on the sphere, is implemented as well.

The "vmf" estimates the mean direction and concentration of a fitted von Mises-Fisher distribution.
The von Mises-Fisher distribution for groups of data is also implemented. The "acg"" fits the angular central Gaussian distribution. There is a constraint on the estimated covariance matrix; its trace is equal to the number of variables. An iterative algorithm takes place and convergence is guaranteed. The "iag" implements MLE of the (hyper-)spherical projected normal distribution. The "esag" is for spherical data, while "ESAGd" is for hyper-spherical data. The "spcauchy" is faster than the "spcacuhy2" because it employs the Newton-Raphson algortihm, but for high dimensions the latter is preferred. Both functions estimate the parameters of the spherical Cauchy distribution, for any dimension. Despite the name sounds confusing, it is implemented for arbitrary dimensions, not only the sphere. The function employs a combination of the fixed points iteration algorithm and the Brent algorithm. The "pkbd" is faster than "pkbd2" beacuse it employs the Newton-Raphson algorithm, but for high dimensions the latter is preferred. Both estimate the parameters of the Poisson kernel based distribution (PKBD), for any dimension. The "sipc" implements MLE of the spherical independent projected Cauchy distribution, for spherical data only.
