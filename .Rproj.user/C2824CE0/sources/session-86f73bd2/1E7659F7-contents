Column-wise MLE of continuous univariate distributions defined on the real line}

\description{
Column-wise MLE of continuous univariate distributions defined on the real line.
}

\usage{
colreal.mle(x, distr = "normal", tol = 1e-07, maxiters = 100, parallel = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A numerical vector with data.
}
\item{distr}{
The distribution to fit, "normal" stands for the normal distribution, "gumbel" for the Gumbel, "cauchy" for the Cauchy, "logistic" for the logistic distribution, "ct" for the (central) t distribution, "t" for the (non-central) t distribution, "wigner" is the Wigner semicircle distribution and "laplace" is the Laplace distribution. "cauchy0" and "gnormal0" are the Cauchy and generalised normal distributions, respectively, with zero location. The generalised normal distribution is also known as the exponential power distribution or the generalized error distribution.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance level to stop the iterative process of finding the MLEs.
}
\item{maxiters}{
The maximum number of iterations to implement.
}
\item{parallel}{
Should the computations take place in parallel?
}
}

\details{
Instead of maximising the log-likelihood via a numerical optimiser we have used a Newton-Raphson algorithm which is faster. See wikipedia for the equation to be solved. For the t distribution we need the degrees of freedom and estimate the location and scatter parameters.

The Cauchy is the t distribution with 1 degree of freedom. The Laplace distribution is also called
double exponential distribution.
}

\value{
A matrix with two, columns. The first one contains the parameters of the distribution
and the second columns contains the log-likelihood values.
