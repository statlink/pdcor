MLE of count data
}

\description{
MLE of count data.
}

\usage{
disc.mle(x, distr = "poisson", N = NULL, type = 1, tol = 1e-07)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A vector with discrete valued data.
}
\item{distr}{
The distribution to fit, "poisson" stands for the Poisson, "zip" for the zero-inflated Poisson,
"ztp" for the zero-truncated Poisson, "negbin" for the negative binomial, "binom" for the binomial,
"borel" for the Borel distribution, "geom" for the geometric, "logseries" for the log-series distribution, "betageom" for the beta-geometric, "betabinom" for the beta-binomial distribution,
"skellam" for the Skellam distribution, "gp" for the generalised Poisson distribution,
"gammapois" for the gamma-Poisson distribution, "cc" for the Cacoullos-Cauchy distribution, "cc0" for the Cacoullos-Cauchy distribution with zero location, "com-pois" for the Conway-Maxwell Poisson (COM-Poisson), and "zicom-pois" for the zero inflated COM-Poisson distribution.
}
\item{N}{
This is for the binomial distribution only, specifying the total number of successes. If NULL, it is sestimated by the data. It can also be a vector of successes.
}
\item{type}{
This argument is for the negative binomial and the geometric distribution.
In the negative binomial you can choose which way your prefer. Type 1 is for smal sample sizes, whereas
type 2 is for larger ones as is faster. For the geometric it is related to its two forms. Type 1 refers to the case where the minimum is zero and type 2 for the case of the minimum being 1.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance level up to which the maximisation stops set to 1e-07 by default.
}
}

\details{
Instead of maximising the log-likelihood via a numerical optimiser we used a Newton-Raphson algorithm which is faster.

See wikipedia for the equation to be solved in the case of the zero inflated distribution. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-inflated_model.
In order to avoid negative values we have used link functions, log for the \eqn{lambda} and logit for the \eqn{\pi} as suggested by Lambert (1992).
As for the zero truncated Poisson see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-truncated_Poisson_distribution.
}

\value{
The following list is not inclusive of all cases. Different functions have different names. In general a list including:
\item{mess}{
This is for the negbin.mle only. If there is no reason to use the negative binomial distribution a message will appear, otherwise this is NULL.
}
\item{iters}{The number of iterations required for the Newton-Raphson to converge.
}
\item{loglik}{The value of the maximised log-likelihood.
}
\item{prob}{The probability parameter of the distribution. In some distributions this argument might have a different name.
For example, param in the zero inflated Poisson.
}
