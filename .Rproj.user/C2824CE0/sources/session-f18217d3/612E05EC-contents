Hypothesis testing for many partial distance correlations
}

\description{
Hypothesis testing for many partial distance correlations.
}

\usage{
mpdcor.test(x, y, z, R = 500)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A numerical vector or matrix.
}
\item{y}{
A numerical vector or  matrix.
}
\item{z}{
A numerical vector or matrix.
}
\item{type}{
In case that all x, y, and z are vectors the user may select the type = 2 which is even faster, but at the expense of requiring more memory.
}
\item{R}{
The number of permutations to implement.
}
}


\details{
Permuation testing using the unbiased partial distance correlation between x and y conditioning on z is computed. \bold{Note:} currently, ony two cases are supported, all x, y, and z are vectors or they are all matrices with the same dimensions.
}

\value{
A vector with the unbiased partial distance correlation, the permutation based p-value and the asymptotic p-value as proposed by Shen, Panda and Vogelstein (2022).
